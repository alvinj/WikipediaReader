Wikipedia Reader
================

As its name implies, the Wikipedia Reader reads Wikipedia web
pages to you. It's still very much a work in progress, but the
basic functionality is here:

* It reads Wikipedia pages.
* You can drag and drop Wikipedia URLs onto the reader to add them to the list.
* The VCR controls usually work. :)
* You can configure the system to read pages to you in (a) one voice,
  or (b) multiple voices.
* You can delete URLs.
* The system remembers your URLs and voice settings (usually).

To use the reader, select a URL, press Play, and listen.

Runs on Mac OS X 10.9
---------------------

I've written this application on Mac OS X 10.9. I don't know
for sure, but it should also run on OS X 10.7 and 10.8, though
I have know way of knowing that for sure; all of my systems run
10.9.
